# Personal Maven/Gradle Repository Collection

This repository serves as a collection of personal Maven/Gradle artifacts (libraries, plugins, etc.) that I can reuse across various Maven and Gradle projects.

The main goal is to provide a centralized and versioned location for custom-built or locally-modified dependencies, allowing for easier integration and management in other projects.
